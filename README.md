# 灵图电商工作室 / Amazon Product Studio

## Stage 8 Final Local Release

This repository is now sealed as the Stage 8 final local ecommerce image studio release on branch `codex/stage-8-final-release`.

For Windows local use, start here:

- One-click startup: `start-lingtu.bat`
- Chinese local guide: `README_LOCAL_ZH.md`
- Final release report: `docs/stages/stage-8/STAGE_8_REPORT.md`
- UI acceptance evidence: `docs/stages/stage-8/UI_ACCEPTANCE.md`

Stage 8 completes the supported local workflow:

```text
创建项目
→ 上传商品参考图
→ 商品识别
→ 产品身份证确认
→ 生成五张主图策划
→ 逐张生成图片
→ 选择五张首选图
→ 下载单图或整套 ZIP
```

Stage 8 added no paid image-generation calls and does not start a Stage 9.

Amazon Product Studio is a production-ready, highly-optimized AI web application. Out of the box, it seamlessly manages User Authentication, Credits & Billing, Image Persistence, and asynchronous AI scene rendering using a sleek Next.js (App Router) architecture. It empowers e-commerce store owners, marketing designers, and brand managers to create stunning studio-quality product photos in seconds — all without expensive photoshoots.

**Why use Amazon Product Studio?**

- **Production-Ready SaaS** — Complete with Google OAuth and Stripe Checkout workflows built-in.
- **AI Scene Studio** — Upload up to 14 product reference photos, select aspect ratios, choose presets or enter custom prompts, and see results instantly.
- **Webhook-Backed AI Delivery** — MuAPI async webhook delivers results directly into the database (`/api/webhooks/ai`), keeping API routes non-blocking and preventing request timeouts.
- **Creations History Gallery** — All generated ad scenes are saved to PostgreSQL. Users can review, compare, download, and track their designs on the main workspace page.
- **Responsive Screen-Fitting** — Designed with a fluid layout that fits perfectly on all screens (mobile, tablet, desktop) using stacked adaptive grids on mobile and viewport-locked scrolling on desktop.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🎨 AI Product Photography Studio (Main Page `/`)
- Multi-image reference uploads supporting up to 14 photos (ideal for transparent product PNGs or standard reference images). Real-time preview thumbnails with delete action.
- Custom dropdown for **Aspect Ratio**: 1:1 (Square), 4:3 (Landscape), 3:4 (Portrait), 16:9 (Widescreen), 9:16 (Story).
- 7 pre-designed scene templates (presets) including: Minimalist Marble, Luxury Spotlight, Rustic Wood, Granite Countertop, Sunny Beach, Forest Moss, and Modern Office.
- Reset to default template button to quickly clear or restore baseline prompt directions.
- Cost: **18 credits** per AI generation.

### 🖼️ Creations History Gallery
- Bottom horizontal thumbnail grid of all generated product listing scenes.
- Cards show a thumbnail and indicators for status (`processing` / `completed` / `failed`).
- Active creation details: prompt overlay, selected aspect ratio, download high-res button, and floating thumbnail references.
- Auto-polls every 4 seconds for processing gallery items, plus 3 seconds active generation polling.

### 💳 Stripe Credit Billing (`/pricing`)
- Four credit packs based on a **$1 = 200 credits** conversion rate:
  - **Basic Pack** ($5 / 1,000 credits — up to 55 generations)
  - **Standard Pack** ($10 / 2,000 credits — up to 111 generations)
  - **Pro Pack** ($20 / 4,000 credits — up to 222 generations — Most Popular)

## ⚡ Deployment: Vercel & Production

This architecture is engineered explicitly for **Vercel** serverless environments.

### One-Click Deploy

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/SamurAIGPT/amazon-product-studio)

**Live App:** [amazon-product-studio.vercel.app](https://amazon-product-studio.vercel.app/)

### 🔑 Required Environment Variables

To successfully deploy and run, you must populate the following environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

| Service | Variable | Description & Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Database** | `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string ([Supabase](https://supabase.com) or [Neon](https://neon.tech)) |
| | `DIRECT_URL` | Non-pooling direct PostgreSQL URL (for migrations) |
| **NextAuth / Google** | `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Secure random string generated via `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| | `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Your production domain (e.g. `https://my-app.vercel.app`) |
| | `WEBHOOK_URL` | Public URL for MuAPI async callbacks (same as `NEXTAUTH_URL` in production) |
| | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Get from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) |
| | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Get from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) |
| **Stripe Billing** | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Get from [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) |
| | `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Get from [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) |
| | `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook secret for resolving credit purchases |
| **AI Generation** | `MU_API_KEY` | Create an account and get key from [muapi.ai/access-keys](https://muapi.ai/access-keys?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=amazon-product-studio) |
| **Theme** | `NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME` | Theme selection (default `dark`) |

### 🚀 Launching on Vercel: Step-by-Step

1. **Database Provisioning**: Create a new Postgres database (via Supabase or Neon). Retrieve the connection string (`DATABASE_URL`).
2. **Project Creation**: Import your GitHub fork into the Vercel dashboard.
3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Copy the variables above into the Vercel project settings environment tab.
4. **Deploy**: Hit "Deploy". Vercel will automatically run the build steps (`npm run build`).
5. **Database Push**: Run `npx prisma db push` to synchronize database models before launching.
6. **Integrations Setup**:
   - Establish a **Google Cloud OAuth app**, enabling the callback URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/google`
   - Setup a **Stripe Webhook**, pointing to `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/stripe/webhook` and selecting the `checkout.session.completed` event.
   - Register a **MuAPI Webhook** pointing to `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks/ai` to receive async generation results.

## 🛠️ Local Development

Ready to iterate locally? Setup is straightforward.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- A local PostgreSQL instance or a free cloud Database URL.
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) (optional, for local MuAPI webhook testing)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SamurAIGPT/amazon-product-studio
cd amazon-product-studio

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Setup Environment
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and insert your specific keys.

# 4. Initialize Database Schema
# Note: Because the database is shared, see the Safety Warning below!
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push

# 5. Start the Development Server
npm run dev
```

The console should now be active on `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Webhook Tip:** For local MuAPI webhook testing, run `ngrok http 3000` and set `WEBHOOK_URL` to the generated HTTPS URL in your `.env`.

## ⚠️ Database Safety Warning (Shared Pool)

The workspace database is shared with other applications. Running `npx prisma db push` on a clean, empty schema will drop tables belonging to other applications. Always follow the **Pull-Declare-Push-Cleanup** sequence:

1. Run `npx prisma db pull` to fetch all database tables.
2. Declare your `AmazonProductCreation` table and update the relations on the `User` model.
3. Run `npx prisma db push` to add your changes safely.
4. Clean up `schema.prisma` to keep only NextAuth models, `AmazonProductCreation`, and the updated `User` relations.
5. Run `npx prisma generate` to rebuild the type-safe client.
